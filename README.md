ðŸ’» Iâ€™m not here to make your life easier. Iâ€™m here to ruin it, make it chaotic, embarrassing, and full of bad decisions.

âš¡ If you think you can handle that shit, pull a request. If you canâ€™t handle it, fuck off. I donâ€™t care. This is my code.

ðŸ–• Disclaimer: Donâ€™t even think about using one of my projects in a serious environment unless you want your career ruined. Your mom will never look at you the same again, and neither will your coworkers. Seriously, get a fucking life.

ðŸ”ª You came here for code, but what youâ€™re really getting is emotional damage and a bad reputation. So, buckle up, weirdo. Let the cringe begin.
